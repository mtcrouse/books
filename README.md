# Grimoire
## By Metta Crouse

Grimoire is a sci-fi fantasy book tracker that can keep track of all books in
your collection and provide suggestions for future reading. This was my capstone
project for Galvanize's Web Development Immersive program.

Grimoire is built with React, JavaScript, HTML, Chart.js, the Google Books API,
Skeleton, CSS, and uses Facebook OAuth for sign-in. I am currently in the process
of improving the search and recommendation functionality and welcome any input.
